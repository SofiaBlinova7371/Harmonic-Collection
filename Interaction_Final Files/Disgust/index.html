                  It all started in 1970, when the Federal Clean Air act was
                  enacted, and incinerators shut down because they did not meet
                  the new emissions guidelines. Soon, the city banned
                  incinerating trash and the Planning Commission decided to
                  replace the incinerators with landfills.

                  However, now New York City faces mountains of trash bags
                  cluttering its sidewalks, due to the lack of alleyways for
                  discreet trash storage and irregular collection times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This results not only in the unpleasant sight and smell, but
                  also in the proliferation of rats, traffic issues, high injury
                  rates, etc.

              “I walk my daughter to school every morning and we have to weave
              in and out, or cross the street, or walk in the middle of the
              street. It’s a hazard. It really is.” - Sunil Vyas

              depressing and so upsetting” - Eric Marcus
